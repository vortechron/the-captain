this project is mostly to manage and make my life easier when working with k8s or using container for my laravel and golang

/base_images (is where other dockerfile can use to extend so that its saves them time to compile, as its name suggest, "base images")
/charts (is helm related charts)
/example (is where actual application usage, just pretend its like one of the laravel application)
/packaged_charts (ignore this, just for deploying helm)
